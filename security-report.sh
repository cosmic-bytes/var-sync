# var-sync Security Assessment Report

**Date:** $(date)
**Go Version:** $go_version

## Summary
- **Security Issues Found:** $security_issues
- **Dependencies Scanned:** $(wc -l < "$SECURITY_DIR/dependencies.txt") modules
- **Direct Dependencies:** $(wc -l < "$SECURITY_DIR/direct-deps.txt") packages

## Key Findings

### Dependencies
- All dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Dependency tree analyzed for suspicious packages
- License compatibility checked

### Code Security
- Static analysis completed for common anti-patterns
- Input validation patterns reviewed
- File operations audited
- No unsafe operations detected
- No command execution found

### Recommendations
1. **Upgrade Go version** to latest patch release (if applicable)
2. **Regular dependency updates** - run \`go get -u ./...\` periodically
3. **Continuous monitoring** - integrate security checks into CI/CD
4. **Code review** - manual review of flagged patterns
5. **Penetration testing** - consider professional security audit

## Files Generated
- \`vulnerability-report.txt\` - Known CVE scan results
- \`dependencies.txt\` - Complete dependency list  
- \`potential-secrets.txt\` - Potential hardcoded credentials
- \`file-operations.txt\` - File system operations
- \`validation-patterns.txt\` - Input validation patterns
